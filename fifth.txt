The discipline of mathematics now covers – in addition to the more or less standard fields of number theory,
 algebra, geometry, analysis (calculus), mathematical logic and set theory, and more applied mathematics 
such as probability theory and statistics – a bewildering array of specialized areas and fields of study, 
including group theory, order theory, knot theory, sheaf theory, topology, differential geometry, fractal geometry,
 graph theory, functional analysis, complex analysis, singularity theory, catastrophe theory, chaos theory, 
measure theory, model theory, category theory, control theory, game theory, complexity theory and many more.
